# ris_engine

Simple game engine, based on a thread-pool-like job system.

⚠️ **very WIP** ⚠️

## Installation

This engine is using SDL2. Trying to compile it without the required SDL2 libraries will most definitely result in a Linker error.

The current target platform of this engine is Windows. I don't guarantee that this engine works on another platform, but if you want to try anyway, I recommend to follow the install instructions [here](https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2#sdl20-development-libraries).

But assuming you are on windows, install SDL2 by following these instructions:

1. In this repo you will find the `./SDL2-2.0.12` directory. It contains all the required SDL2 libraries. If your OS and toolchain are 64 bit, choose the libraries in the `x64` directory. If they are 32 bit, choose the libraries in the x86 directory.
2. Copy `SDL2.dll` to the root of this repository
3. Copy **ALL** `.lib` files to:

> C:\\Users\\{Your Username}\\.rustup\\toolchains\\{current toolchain}\\lib\\rustlib\\{current toolchain}\\lib

4. When all libraries are installed properly, you can now simply run `cargo run`.

_All SDL2 libraries in this repo come from the `SDL2-devel-2.0.12-VC.zip` package, which I downloaded [here](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-2.0.12)._
